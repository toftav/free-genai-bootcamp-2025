Functional Requirements
The company wants to minimize the costs for the Gen AI system. For that purpose, they decided to implement an in-house solution with sub- 15K hardware and open source software. They have 300 active students located within the same city.

Assumptions
1/ The Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on cheap hardware.
2/ A single server and internet connection setup in our office will be enough compute/bandwith to serve all 300 students.

Data Strategy
There is a concerned of copyrighted materials, so we must ensure the data flowing to/from the LLM is properly sanitized.

Considerations
In addition, to mitigate copyright issues, we're considering using one of the most transparent LLMs available, IBM Granite.
